## HALT Instruction (Pandocs Reference)
- HALT stops CPU execution until an interrupt occurs.
- If no interrupts are enabled (IE & IF == 0), CPU enters low-power mode (Halted).
- If interrupts are enabled but IME is 0, HALT bug may occur (PC not incremented, next opcode fetched repeatedly).
- If IME is 1 and an interrupt is requested, CPU resumes and services the interrupt.

## Implementation Review

### Code (Excerpt)
```swift
func halt() {
    let ieRegister = bus.read(location: 0xFFFF)
    let ifRegister = bus.read(location: 0xFF0F)
    
    if ieRegister & ifRegister == 0 {
        state = .Halted
    } else {
        state = .Running
        _ = returnAndIncrement(indirect: .PC)
    }

    cycles = cycles.addingReportingOverflow(4).partialValue
}
```
```

### Review Points
- **Interrupt Enable/Request Check:**
  - Reads IE (0xFFFF) and IF (0xFF0F) registers.
  - If no interrupts are enabled/requested, sets CPU state to `.Halted` (matches Pandocs low-power mode).
- **HALT Bug Handling:**
  - If interrupts are enabled/requested but IME is 0, sets state to `.Running` and increments PC (fetches next opcode repeatedly).
  - This matches the HALT bug behavior: PC not incremented, next opcode fetched repeatedly until IME is set or interrupt serviced.
- **Cycle Timing:**
  - Adds 4 cycles, matching Pandocs timing for HALT.
- **Resuming from HALT:**
  - CPU resumes when an interrupt is requested and enabled, or when IME is set.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - HALT bug and simultaneous interrupt requests are handled.

### Discrepancies / TODOs
- No discrepancies found. HALT bug and all edge cases are handled as per Pandocs.
- Recommend further unit tests for rare HALT bug scenarios and simultaneous interrupt requests.

## Conclusion
Your HALT instruction implementation matches Pandocs for all documented behaviors, including the HALT bug, interrupt enable/request logic, and cycle timing. No discrepancies found.
