## Detailed Findings

### Arithmetic/Logic Instructions
- **add, adc, sub, sbc, and, or, xor, cp, daa, cpl, ccf**: All present. Flag updates (Z, N, H, C) match Pandocs. Edge cases (carry, half-carry, signed) handled. Cycle counts correct.
- **addSigned**: Correct signed addition and flag logic.

### Bit Operations
- **bit, set, reset, swap, shift/rotate**: All CB-prefixed instructions implemented. Flag logic and cycle counts match Pandocs. Indirect and register variants present.

### Load/Store Instructions
- **load, store, memory access**: All register-to-register, indirect, and masked memory operations present. Stack pointer masking for AF register correct. Cycle counts match Pandocs.

### Jump/Call/Ret Instructions
- **jump, call, ret, rst, conditional variants**: All present. PC/SP manipulation and cycle timing correct. Signed/unsigned and conditional logic handled.

### Stack Operations
- **push, pop**: Correct masking for AF register. Cycle counts and memory access correct.

### Control Instructions
- **DI, EI, halt, unused**: All present. IME and delayed IME logic correct. Halt edge case (interrupt enable/flag) handled. Unused opcode decrements PC as expected.

### Extended Opcodes
- **CB-prefixed**: All major bit, shift, and set/reset instructions present. Flag and cycle logic correct.

### Interrupts
- **VBlank, LCD, Timer, Joypad**: All implemented and match Pandocs for priority, flag/enable logic, stack push, and PC jump.
- **Serial Interrupt**: Marked TODO. Not yet implemented.

### Unused/Edge Cases
- **Unused opcodes**: Handled by `unused()` function. No crash or undefined behavior.
- **Edge cases**: Signed/unsigned, overflow/underflow, masking, and indirect addressing all handled.

---

## Discrepancies / TODOs
- **Serial Interrupt**: Not yet implemented. Add logic to set and process serial interrupt flag/enable.
- **Testing**: Recommend further unit tests for edge cases and rare opcodes.

---

## Recommendations
- Implement Serial Interrupt logic in `processInterrupt()` and related areas.
- Continue to maintain cycle and flag accuracy as per Pandocs.
- Add/expand unit tests for edge cases and rare instructions.

---

## Conclusion
Your instruction set implementation in `CPU.swift` is comprehensive and matches Pandocs for all major opcode groups. All flag, register, memory, and cycle logic is accurate. Only the Serial Interrupt remains as a TODO. No other discrepancies found.
